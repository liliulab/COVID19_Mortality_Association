COVID-19 Mortality is Associated with Impaired Innate Immunity in Pre-existing Health Conditions - Frontiers of Medicine

Background: COVID-19 poses a life-threatening endangerment to individuals with chronic
diseases. However, not all comorbidities affect COVID-19 prognosis equally. Some increase the
risk of COVID-19 related death by more than six folds while others show little to no impact. To
prevent severe outcomes, it is critical that we comprehend pre-existing molecular abnormalities
in common health conditions that predispose patients to poor prognoses. In this study, we aim
to discover some of these molecular risk factors by associating gene expression dysregulations
in common health conditions with COVID-19 mortality rates in different cohorts.

Methods: We focused on fourteen pre-existing health conditions, for which age-and-sex-
adjusted hazard ratios of COVID-19 mortality have been documented. For each health
condition, we analyzed existing transcriptomics data to identify differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) between affected individuals and unaffected individuals. We then tested if fold changes
of any DEG in these pre-existing conditions were correlated with hazard ratios of COVID-19
mortality to discover molecular risk factors. We performed gene set enrichment analysis to
identify functional groups overrepresented in these risk factor genes and examined their
relationships with the COVID-19 disease pathway.

Results: We found that upregulated expression of 70 genes and downregulated expression of
181 genes in pre-existing health conditions were correlated with increased risk of COVID-19
related death. These genes were significantly enriched with endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
function, proinflammatory reaction, and interferon production that participate in viral transcription
and immune responses to viral infections.

Conclusions: Impaired innate immunity in pre-existing health conditions are associated with
increased hazard of COVID-19 mortality. The discovered molecular risk factors are potential
prognostic biomarkers and targets for therapeutic interventions.
